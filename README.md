## Description of the Settlers of Catan game
This game is a multiplayer game, it can be played between 3-6 people. The object of Settlers of Catan is to be the first to gain 10 victory points. Points are earned by building structures, buying cards, and earning accomplishment cards such as “Longest Road” and “Largest Army”.

In the beginning of the game, land hexes are shuffled and placed on the table in the shape of a hexagon. The water hexes are placed in a way that they cover the hexagon. Later, numbers are placed on top of every land hex except for the desert hex. These tokens are placed in an alphabetical order, starting from the corner of the hexagon. Rubber token is placed on the desert hex. 

To start the game, each player choses a color and places a settlement and a road adjacently, on their part of the board. This goes on for another round until each player has two settlements and two adjoint roads. Later on each player, in turn, draws the relevant cards according to how many and which hexes are touching their last placed settlement. The game goes on in clockwise direction until there is a winner.
